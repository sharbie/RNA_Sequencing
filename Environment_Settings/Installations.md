### Before you move on, be sure that you understand the mechinisms of RNA sequencing
### I would recommend that you either use Linux or MacOS when performing such analysis since many tools are only compatible with Unix-like systems.
### Be sure that you systems and all packages are under the **most latest stable version**.

### several techniques that you should get prepared
1. Python
2. R
3. Command Line Tools
4. Bash Script

### Please check that all current packages on analyzing RNA sequencing data are based on python2 version while analysis on R is not affected.
